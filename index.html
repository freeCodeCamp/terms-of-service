      website. If you find anything on freeCodeCamp that you believe violates
      these Terms of Service, please email us at

          of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct. That
          is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which
          includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code.
          By using <a href="https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>, you
          represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate
          these terms or the <a href=

          license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely
          for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your

          content available to third parties selected by freeCodeCamp (through
          the freeCodeCamp Firehose, for example) so that these third parties
          can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) your content

          "https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> websites and add their
          own Content to it (aka to reblog your Content), so long as they use
          only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original
          author by linking back to your website. If you delete Content,
          freeCodeCamp will use reasonable efforts to remove it from <a href=
          "https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>, but you acknowledge
          that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately
          unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or
          warranties, freeCodeCamp has the right (though not the obligation)
          to, in freeCodeCamp’s sole discretion, (i) refuse or remove any
          content that, in freeCodeCamp’s reasonable opinion, violates any
          freeCodeCamp policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or
          (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of <a href=

          entity for any reason. freeCodeCamp will have no obligation to

      including computer software, posted to our Services, and cannot therefore
      be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating
      our Services, freeCodeCamp does not represent or imply that it endorses
      the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be
      accurate, useful, or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking
      precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems
      from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive
      content. Our Services may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or
      otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical
      inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. Our Services may
      also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or
      infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of
      third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to
      additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. freeCodeCamp
      disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by
      visitors of our Services, or from any downloading by those visitors of
      content there posted.</p>


      <h4><a id="5_Content_Posted_on_Other_Websites_53"></a>5. Content Posted
      on Other Websites.</h4>


      <p>We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material,
      including computer software, made available through the websites and
      webpages to which <a href="https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>
      links, and that link to <a href=
      "https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. freeCodeCamp does not
      have any control over those non-freeCodeCamp.org websites, and is not
      responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a
      non-freeCodeCamp.org website, freeCodeCamp does not represent or imply
      that it endorses such website. You are responsible for taking precautions
      as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses,

      freeCodeCamp disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from
      your use of non-freeCodeCamp.org websites and webpages.</p>


      <h4><a id="6_Copyright_Infringement_and_DMCA_Policy_57"></a>6. Copyright
      Infringement and DMCA Policy.</h4>


      <p>As freeCodeCamp asks others to respect its intellectual property
      rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you
      believe that material located on or linked to by <a href=
      "https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> violates your copyright,
      you are encouraged to notify freeCodeCamp in accordance with <a href=
      "https://www.freeCodeCamp.org/dmca-notice/">freeCodeCamp’s Digital Millennium
      Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Policy</a>. freeCodeCamp will respond to all such
      notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing
      material or disabling all links to the infringing material. freeCodeCamp
      will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the Website if, under
      appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat
      infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of
      freeCodeCamp or others.</p>


      <h4><a id="7_Intellectual_Property_61"></a>7. Intellectual Property.</h4>


      <p>This Agreement does not transfer from freeCodeCamp to you any
      freeCodeCamp or third party intellectual property, and all right, title,
      and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties)
      solely with freeCodeCamp. freeCodeCamp, <a href=
      "https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>, the <a href=
      "https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> logo, and all other
      trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with
      <a href="https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> or our Services,
      are trademarks or registered trademarks of freeCodeCamp or freeCodeCamp’s
      licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in
      connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third
      parties. Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to
      reproduce or otherwise use any freeCodeCamp or third-party
      trademarks.</p>


      <h4><a id="10_Changes_73"></a>10. Changes.</h4>


      <p>We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we
      have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If
      we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one
      of our websites, or by sending you an email or other communication before
      the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of
      time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our
      changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated
      notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the
      new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be
      governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration
      clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.</p>


      <h4><a id="11_Termination_77"></a>11. Termination.</h4>


      <p>freeCodeCamp may terminate your access to all or any part of our
      Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice,
      effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your
      <a href="https://www.freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> account (if you
      have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services. All provisions
      of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall
      survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions,
      warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>


      <h4><a id="12_Disclaimer_of_Warranties_81"></a>12. Disclaimer of
      Warranties.</h4>


      <p>Our Services are provided “as is.” freeCodeCamp and its suppliers and

      its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Services will be
      error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. If
      you’re actually reading this, we praise your diligence and concern. We'd
      be better off as a civilization if more people cared like you do. You
      understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or
      services through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.</p>


      <h4><a id="13_Limitation_of_Liability_85"></a>13. Limitation of
      Liability.</h4>


      <p>In no event will freeCodeCamp, or its suppliers or licensors, be
      liable with respect to any subject matter of this Agreement under any
      contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory
      for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost
      of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for
      interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any
      amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to freeCodeCamp under this
      agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of
      action. freeCodeCamp shall have no liability for any failure or delay due
      to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply
      to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
